      - This feature file covers the scenarios related
        only with the elements outside the minefield

        of the core scenarios

      How to refer to a cell:
      - Using the (row,column) nomenclature
      - Rows and columns starts from 1

      How to load mock data
      - Using the <ctrl>+m keyboard combination to discover
      the load mock data form

      To define the board data will use:
      "o" No mine
      "*" Mine
      "-" Row separator

      Thera are two ways to define mock data
      - Inline:
      "***-ooo-*oo"
